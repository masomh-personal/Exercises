/**
 * Time: O(n)
 * - We iterate over the array once to populate the occurrenceMap, which takes O(n).
 * - We iterate over the occurrenceMap to check for unique frequencies, which takes O(n).
 * - Since all other operations (Map.get(), Set.has(), Set.add()) are O(1), the overall time complexity is O(n).
 *
 * Space: O(n)
 * - We store elements in the occurrenceMap and uniqueFreqSet, both of which can grow up to the size of the input array.
 * - Therefore, the space complexity is O(n), where n is the size of the input array.
